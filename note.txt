  // Currently you have a camera with some stats
  // You also are sweeping the screen outputing pixel color values
  
  //Need:
  // get the viewport matrix working
  // send rays from the camera to the middle of each of the viewport pixel middles - Change to multiple random ones to get anti-alisasing, should be easy to implment and a lot of points... maybe?
  // Get shapes working where you see if you hit a sphere and if you hit a triangle

  // Then:
  // materials
  // lights

  // lots of complicated stuff to get done, espcially when you don't know the language. Feel like I am learning though. I should probably read through the leacture notes and through the textbook a few times
  // before writing anymore code. So far it is original but anything progressing will be me just ripping it off
